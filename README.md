The following is a collection of my favorite lines from the zen of python.

"Simple is better than complex."
"Complex is better than complicated."
The first line points out the importance of keeping your code simple when possible, and in a lot of cases, simplicity is the way to go,
but when solving complex problems, continuously striving for "simplicity" might make the solution even more complicated.
I like these lines because it reminds me that there is a time and place for everything, and there is no "one size fits all".

"Readability counts."
Programming is not always a one man job, and when working with other people, readability is incredibly important.
Short and simple, straight to the point, love it.

"In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess."
This line hits very close to home. At times where I've encountered errors or complex problems, 
I've wasted many hours throwing random guesses and failing repeatedly.
In the face of the unknown, I often find myself frustrated and too fed up to think critically,
so i resort to random guessing, in hopes that one of them would magically be the solution.
But the chances of success are slim to none at all, and I end up wasting A LOT of time.
This line is definitely my favorite, because it is a great reminder to work smarter, and choose the more productive way of problem solving.
